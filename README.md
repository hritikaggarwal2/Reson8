# Reson8
Reson8 was built during Hack Washington 2019 with a team of 4 people. Reson8 allows people with the inability to speak a means of communication through their hand gestures. A Myo band keeps track of these hand gestures and converts them into text. This text is then sent to Alexa for either communicating with other people (acting as a speaker) or communicating directly with Alexa (acting as a Home Automation Device).

It usese Raspberry Pi kernel in order to communicate with Amazon Alexa. The kernel can be found at - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a7o8XnYT2gcfSpY4Q3SxxkjYBzFGf94D/view?usp=sharing
